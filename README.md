A simple chrome plugin that makes quora easy on eyes during night.

Just open quora page and turn on the plugin. 

Installation details - 
1. Clone everything.
2. Unzip images folder in the same place.
3. Open chrome and go to settings -> more tools -> add extensions 
4. Turn on developer mode using the toggle button
5. Choose load unpacked and open the parent folder of plugin

Bonus: Removes header also from quora, I find the red notifications signs distracting :/
